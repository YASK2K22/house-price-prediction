Data Science & Analytics - Predictive Modeling (House Prices)
This project will demonstrate basic data loading, preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression), and evaluation using pandas and scikit-learn.

Concept: We'll use a simulated dataset for house prices and build a simple linear regression model to predict prices based on features like area.
